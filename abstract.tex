%Mobile computing is becoming the preferred method of personal computing
%environment for millions of users.
%
%Furthermore, the growth of the mobile device market has been inspired by the
%hundreds of thousands of mobile applications such as social networking,
%location-based services, image processing, augmented reality, and
%face/speech recognition.
%
%In order to meet the increasing demands of these computationally-intense
%applications, recent mobile platforms have been augmented with multi-core CPUs,
%more powerful GPUs and other special types of hardware accelerators.
%
%Despite of these enhancements to mobile platform's hardware,
%however, the inescapable fact is that their limited capacities of the
%batteries will always serve as a bottleneck while hindering the mobile
%platforms from utilizing their computing capabilities.\\
%
%To address this restriction, there have been research efforts on remote
%offloading systems which seek intelligent ways to enable mobile
%platform developers to leverage computing capabilities of more powerful
%resources over the network. 
%
%Even though existing approaches provide core mechanisms to transform
%typical mobile applications to offloading-enabled applications through
%various granularities of partitioning and/or migration, they still lack
%considerations for service discovery mechanisms while assuming the
%availability of remote computing nodes with static endpoints.
%
%Moreover, they have not investigated data privacy and secure
%communication between the mobile client and remote resources, which can
%be a crucial flaw for mobile computing environments.\\
%
%This dissertation presents a novel framework which enables remote workload
%offloading to external resources within a mobile user's Social Device
%Network in which trusted remote computing resources such as family
%or friend's desktops or laptops are aggregated regardless of the user's
%mobility.
%
%The proposed system accomplishes this by 1) utilizing a peer-to-peer
%virtual private networking technique as a substrate for the discovery
%and configuration of trusted remote resources, and 2) extending OpenCL
%framework, which is an open standard of parallel programming for
%heterogeneous computing environments, to support remote offloading using
%the TCP/IP networking stack. 
%
%This work thus broadens the range of heterogeneous
%computing to remote computing capabilities in the network, where
%offloading servers and services are dynamically discovered.\\
%
%The prototype implementation of the proposed framework is evaluated,
%with regard to end-to-end application performance and energy
%consumption in mobile devices, through a variety of network
%configurations representing local and wide area network, and various
%levels of remote computing capabilities such as typical CPUs, GPUs as
%well as Amazon EC2 instances.
%
%According to the evaluation, the proposed architecture achieves more
%energy efficient performance by offloading than executing locally
%depending on the characteristics of mobile workloads and network
%conditions.\\
%
%Based on the evaluation results, mobile workloads are characterized for
%the suitability of offloading from the perspective of computation to
%communication ratio which is a comprehensive measurement mirroring
%network conditions and workload characteristics.
%
%In addition, this dissertation proposes applying machine learning
%techniques to runtime schedulers for mobile offloading framework.
%
%By adopting machine learning techniques to remote offloading
%scheduling problems, a scheduler can be automatically trained from
%previous offloading performance and make decisions on whether mobile
%workloads should be offloaded or executed locally according to past
%behaviors and current conditions.
%
%While running various machine learning algorithms, the evaluation shows the
%feasibility of adopting machine learning techniques into scheduling
%problems for mobile offloading framework.\\
%
%As the future work, the current resource discovery technique will be 
%further extended into the consideration of keeping track of a more 
%complex set of conditions of multiple remote computing resources such 
%as network latency, bandwidth, and computing capabilities of remote 
%resources, and the provision of the most appropriate resource in 
%accordance with network conditions and mobile application requirements.
%
%Also, the machine learning-based runtime scheduler will be modularized
%so that it provides well-defined APIs, and the proposed runtime scheduler
%can be plugged and played for various types of adaptive scheduling
%problems.
%
%In doing so, it is possible to characterize the performance, benefits,
%and overhead of different types of machine learning algorithms in online
%schedulers for mobile offloading frameworks.
%
%As part of the modularization of the machine learning-based runtime
%scheduler, I am currently working on the online scheduler for Java-based
%on-demand code offloading system.

whether mobile workloads should be offloaded or executed locally
according to the current conditions at runtime.
